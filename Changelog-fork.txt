Asuswrt-Merlin fork Changelog
===============================

Added backported z3fold from Linux 5.8 to allow for memory compaction after
      zswap usage (reduce kernel memory fragmentation, reduce out of memory
      conditions)
Added backported af_packet from Linux 4.4.y to plug some race conditions and
      harden some security issues related to af_packet usage
Added backported mm/migrate from Linux 4.4.y to help reduce memory fragmentation
      caused by kernel drivers such as zswap and others
Added sch_cake (aka CAKE QoS) module as part of kernel build
Added CPUfreq driver (RT-AC86U)
      Undo tons of BCM/Asus hack on cpufreq
      enable OnDemand CPU governor, now CPU will scale its frequencies based
      on load demands (hopefully lower power consumption and lower heat) not
      running at 1.8 GHz needlessly at all times.  Now will scale from 225MHz
      to 1.8 GHz based on load demands.
Added Wireguard module (RT-AC86U) as part of kernel build
Added BFQ I/O Scheduler (RT-AC86U) for use with USB HDD since BFQ is better
      noop for external HDD.  default noop is still recommended for USB sticks
      or SSD.
Added ZSWAP optimizations from Linux 4.8 (RT-AC86U)
      ZSWAP using z3fold (2.6x compression average)
      ZSWAP using lz4 compressor
      ZSWAP using btree instead of rb-tree for better performance
Added IPV6 route optimization from Linux 4.2 (RT-AC86U)

Additional Notes:
With pktrunner (proprietary kernel module) and pktflow acceleration
(another proprietary kernel module) disabled when entering promiscuous mode as
required by Suricata + CAKEQoS, every bit of performance optimization from
base Linux kernel will help to make up for lack of proprietary HW accelertaion.

TrendMicro has several proprietary kernel modules such as tdts_udbfw
(TrendMicro engine), tdts_udb (TrendMicro database interface) and the infamous
DCD (Data Collection Daemon, which constantly has level 3 translation errors),
these and the other proprietary kernel modules makes the firmware difficult to
be fully optimized without breaking something.

Not having full source to those modules makes this enhancement projects harder
and more difficult to keep bug free (whenever the kernel panicked in those
proprietary modules, it is nearly impossible to troubleshoot or fix).

Following enhancements removed from TrendMicro builds (it will cause NPE in
kernel with tdts_udb proprietary kernel module :'( )

GPL ONLY Builds:

Added ARM64 library optimizations from Linux 5.8+ (RT-AC86U)
      including optimized 128bit integer, optimized csum for net use,
      optimized IPV6 csum etc
Added ARM64 kernel crypto libraries including chacha20, SHA256/512 (RT-AC86U)
      enabled ARM64_CRYPTO and tons of ARMV8 crypto extensions from Linux 4.1
      up to Linux 5.6
      Kernel crypto interface isn't great, in fact using it actually lowers
      performance of the applications.
      Best use with devcrypto out-of-tree patches.
