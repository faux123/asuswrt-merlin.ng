Asuswrt-Merlin fork Changelog
===============================

Added Wireguard (RT-AC86U)
Added BFQ I/O Scheduler (RT-AC86U) for use with USB HDD
Added ZSWAP optimizations from Linux 4.8 (RT-AC86U)
      ZSWAP using z3fold (2.6x compression average)
      ZSWAP using lz4 compressor
      ZSWAP using btree instead of rb-tree for better performance
Added IPV6 route optimization from Linux 4.2 (RT-AC86U)
Added ARM64 library optimizations from Linux 4.5+ (RT-AC86U)
      including optimized 128bit integer, optimized csum for net use
Added ARM64 kernel crypto libraries including chacha20, SHA256/512 (RT-AC86U)
      enabled ARM64_CRYPTO (not sure if many userspace uses kernel crypto or not)

With pktrunner and flowcache HW acceleration disabled when using Suricata + CAKEQoS
every bit of performance optimization from base Linux kernel would help make up for
lack of HW accelertaion.
