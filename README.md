asuswrt-merlin New Gen (version 384.17 fork)
==================================================

Asuswrt-Merlin is an enhanced version of Asuswrt, the firmware used by Asus's modern routers.

The goal of this project is to fix issues and bring some minor functionality adjustments to the 
original Asus firmware.  While some features do get added, this is not the main focus of this project.  
It is not meant to replace existing projects such as Tomato or DD-WRT, but rather to offer an alternative 
for people who prefer the original firmware featureset.

This is the new development branch, originally based on Asus's 
3.0.0.4.382_xxxx firmware release.  Development of the 380.xx 
legacy branch has been dropped.

This is a custom fork from Asuswrt-Merlin version 384.17 release.
This custom fork contained hybrid Linux kernel V4.1.x with new enhancements from newer releases (such as v4.2.x and v4.8.x).
This fork has only been tested on RT-AC86U and RT-AC68U.
