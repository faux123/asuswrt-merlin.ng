asuswrt-merlin New Gen (fork)
==================================================

Asuswrt-Merlin is an enhanced version of Asuswrt, the firmware used by Asus's modern routers.

The goal of this fork is to add some new enhancements and bring some minor functionality adjustments to the 
original Merlin firmware.

It is not meant to replace existing projects such as Tomato or DD-WRT, but rather to offer an alternative 
for people who prefer the original firmware featureset.

This custom fork has only been tested on RT-AC86U and RT-AC68U
